# IoT Python Thermostat Simulator

Welcome to the **IoT Python Thermostat Simulator**! This project simulates an IoT device that generates random temperature and humidity data, sending it to ThingSpeak for monitoring and visualization. This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates real-time data generation and integration with the ThingSpeak IoT platform.

## Overview
This project is a simple yet effective simulation of an IoT thermostat device. It uses Python to generate random temperature (20-30Â°C) and humidity (30-60%) values every 60 seconds and sends them to a ThingSpeak channel for real-time tracking. The code includes error handling and debugging features, making it a robust example for IoT development.

## Features
- Generates random temperature and humidity data within realistic ranges.
- Sends data to ThingSpeak using the HTTP GET request method.
- Includes robust error handling for network issues and API failures.
- Provides debug output for troubleshooting.
- Configurable with a ThingSpeak Write API Key.
